        <p>As part of your experience with us at the lodge, we will provide and
           cook the food for you and your guests. If you have dietary restrictions or needs,
            let us know and weâ€™ll cater the meals to you and your group. If you decide you want
            to bring your own food and cook your own meals, you can do that too! Just let us
            know what works best for you.</p>
